This repository is my personal workspace and learning journal for the **Fullstack Cohort3** program by **100xDevs**. ðŸš€

Here, I store **everything I learn, practice, and build** throughout the course â€” from notes and assignments to practice projects and useful resources.  
Itâ€™s mainly for **my own reference and growth** over the next few months (or even a year), but if anyone else finds it helpful, thatâ€™s a great bonus!
