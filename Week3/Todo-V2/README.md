## 🚀 What I Learned

While building this project, I explored and practiced the following concepts:

- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically adding, removing, and editing elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling**: Used `addEventListener` to respond to user interactions like clicks and checkbox changes.
- **JavaScript Objects & Arrays**: Stored todos as objects in an array and updated them as needed.
- **Conditional Styling**: Applied line-through style to completed tasks.
- **HTML Form Elements**: Learned how checkboxes work and how to style them.
- **Basic CSS Styling**: Styled the layout, buttons, and elements for a casual and clean look.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how to build interactive components from scratch without using any libraries or frameworks.
